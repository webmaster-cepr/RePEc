Title: Working Paper: Domestic Outsourcing, Rent Seeking, and Increasing Inequality

Creation-Date: 2017-02
Abstract: An increasing share of the economy is organized around financial capitalism, where, in contrast to the past, capital market actors actively assert and manage their claims on wealth creation and distribution. These new actors challenge prior assumptions of managerial capitalism about the goals and governance of firms. The focus on shareholder value is credited with increasing firm efficiency and shareholder returns. This lecture analyzes the changes in organizational behavior and value extraction under financial capitalism.

Title: Who Pays if We Raise the Social Security Payroll Tax Cap?

Abstract: Most Americans know that their earnings are subject to the Social Security payroll tax. Not as many are aware that the amount of earnings subject to the tax, while subject to change, is capped at the same level for everyone, regardless of total earnings. This year, the maximum wage earnings subject to the payroll tax is $127,200. The cap on the Social Security payroll tax means that those with the highest earnings pay a lower rate.

Using Census Bureau data from the latest American Community Survey (ACS), this issue brief updates previous CEPR research to determine how many people would be affected if the payroll tax cap were raised or eliminated.

Title: Working Paper: Economic Policy in the Trump Era
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2017-02
Abstract: The debate on economic policy in the United States and elsewhere is typically framed as one between conservatives who like the market and progressives who favor a large role for government. This is both wrong and wrong in a way that hugely favors conservatives. Progressive policy should focus on creating alternative structures that reverse the upward redistribution of the last four decades. While the likelihood for much progress in this direction at the national level during the Trump administration seems minimal, there will be opportunities in states where progressives still have substantial political power.

Title: The Affordable Care Act and the Change in Voluntary Part-time Employment by States
Author-Name: Dean Baker

Abstract: A major goal of the ACA was to give workers the ability to obtain insurance outside of their employment, so that they would not be tied to a job that doesn’t meet their needs or fully utilize their skills due of their need for health insurance. The jump in voluntary part-time employment since the exchanges went into operation is an indication that the ACA has had this effect. This paper gives the breakdown of this increase by state. Presumably, if the ACA were repealed without some comparable or better system of insurance put in its place, these numbers should give an indication of how many people would again be forced to seek out full-time employment to get employer-provided health insurance, even though part-time work better fits their needs.

Title: Update: Are Lower Private Equity Returns the New Normal?
Author-Name: Eileen Appelbaum
Author-Name: Rosemary Batt
Creation-Date: 2017-03
Abstract: This report updates a version released in June 2016.

U.S. private equity fundraising had its best year ever in 2015 — raising $185 billion. But is the enthusiasm of investors warranted? Do PE buyout funds deliver outsized returns to investors and will they do so in the future? This report answers this question by reviewing the most recent empirical evidence on buyout fund performance; the answer is no. While median private equity buyout funds once beat the S&P 500, they have not done so since 2006 — despite industry claims to the contrary.

Title: Stick Shift: Autonomous Vehicles, Driving Jobs, and the Future of Work

Abstract: At this moment, more than 30 companies across the globe say they are working on autonomous-vehicle technology. These companies range from computing-technology firms like Apple, Google, and Intel to those usually associated with automobile manufacturing[1] such as BMW, Ford, Honda, and Volvo.[2] Their most optimistic predictions are that in as few as three to five years,[3] fully autonomous vehicles—automobiles without human drivers—will be in regular use on the road.

Predictions vary about whether fully autonomous vehicles, Level 5 on the SAE International classification scale for autonomous-vehicle technology[4], will be introduced first. Yet, given the number of companies working to make improvements and the progress already made with Level 4 technology—which marks the stage when vehicles are classified as being capable of safely driving themselves in predictable spaces—it is highly possible that the technology will progress to Level 5 in the near future. Many economists, pundits, and companies are predicting just that.

Autonomous-vehicle technology offers a number of positive opportunities. It has the potential to save many lives, limit environmental damage, increase productivity and, as a result, improve living standards across the country if the gains are distributed equally.[5] But the technology also has the potential to cause significant economic hardship for a number of workers, at least in the short term. For those who drive vehicles for a living, the full financial impact of this technological change will depend, in large part, on whether the transition takes a while or occurs relatively quickly. It will also depend heavily on whether the initial technology deployed is fully or partially autonomous.

Overall, 2.86 percent of all workers in the United States are employed in driving occupations. Though it is possible that workers displaced by autonomous-vehicle technology may eventually find new jobs at some point, the analysis contained in this paper is focused on the immediate, short-term impact to employment in the transportation sector if a rapid transition to fully autonomous vehicles were to occur. Using data from the 2010 to 2014 merged American Community Survey released by the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper estimates the labor market impact of jobs likely to be lost with a rapid transition to autonomous vehicles. The report finds that certain population groups and areas of the country would be disproportionately affected. Finally, we call for policymakers to take immediate steps to offset the potential for harmful labor disruptions.
