Title: Free Ride: The Senate Health Bill’s Approach to “Employer Responsibility” Means Some Large Employers Get to Take It Easy
Author-Name: Shawn Fremstad
Author-Person: pfr147
Creation-Date: 2009-12
Abstract: Leaders in both the House and the Senate have committed to "shared responsibility"
as a basic principle of health care reform, meaning that the costs of health care coverage
are shared by individuals, businesses, and the public sector.  However, as this issue brief
documents, the Senate version of the bill creates a free rider problem that would
make it easy for many large and profitable employers, particularly the ones paying
poor wages, to shirk their responsibilities.

Creation-Date: 2009-12
Abstract: Many proponents of conservative fiscal policies talk of the budget
deficit as being a matter of intergenerational equality. However, this paper
shows the younger generations (and those yet to be born) will contribute more
to the deficit than older generations.  This analysis uses data from the CBO
Long-Term Budget Outlook and the authors' calculations to show that the driving
force behind the deficit is our broken health care system and that this should
be the focus of the debate.

Creation-Date: 2009-12
Abstract: The strong rise in the U.S. stock market since the spring and the
return to positive economic growth in the third quarter of this year have created
a consensus among economists that the Great Recession is very likely over.
Unfortunately, the end of the official recession will have little visible impact
on U.S. labor markets until almost 2012. Within that time, this paper estimates
that U.S. workers will have lost over $1 trillion in wages and salaries, $150
billion more than the 10-year costs of proposed health care reform legislation.

Title: Issues in Trade and Protectionism

Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-11
Abstract: There is widespread concern that the United States and the rest of the
world are descending into a round of protectionism and a trade war reminiscent
of what the world experienced in the Great Depression. Such concerns are both
overblown and misplaced. In the short term, the main concern in the United States
and rest of the world should be to promote an increase in demand through whatever
means necessary. For the longer term, there has been an excessive fixation on
protection for merchandise trade. Other areas, most notably alternative intellectual
property regimes and freer trade in highly paid professional services, offer much
larger potential gains than further reductions in barriers to trade in goods.

Creation-Date: 2009-11
Abstract: Asian Pacific American (APA) workers are, with Latinos, the fastest
growing group in the U.S. workforce and in organized labor. Since the late 1980s,
APA workers have seen their representation in the ranks of U.S. unions almost double,
from about 2.5 percent of all union workers in 1989 to about 4.6 percent in 2008.

This report uses national data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) to show
that unionization raises the wages of the typical APA worker by 9 percent compared
to their non-union peers. The study goes on to show that unionization also increases
the likelihood that an APA worker will have health insurance and a pension.

Title: Honduras: Recent Economic Performance
Author-Name: Jose Antonio Cordero
Creation-Date: 2009-11
Abstract: This paper looks at the Honduran economy, including longer-term trends,
the pre-crisis years, and recent developments since the June 28th coup. It finds
that poverty and inequality decreased significantly during the Zelaya administration,
with rapid growth of more than 6 percent during the first two years. The government
also increased school enrollment significantly by abolishing school fees, expanded
school lunch programs, and raised the minimum wage by 60 percent. Some expansionary
monetary policy was used to counter-act the global downturn in 2008. The paper finds
that more recently, the Honduran economy has become especially
vulnerable to the combined impacts of the world recession and the political
crisis that has followed the military coup of June 28, 2009.

Abstract: This paper is part of a discussion between CEPR and the International

Policies and the World Recession: A Look at Forty-One Borrowing Countries.”
An IMF representative presented a response to that paper at an October 15, 2009
event in Washington D.C., in remarks and a power point presentation. The earlier
CEPR paper examined IMF agreements with 41 countries during the current global
recession and found that 31 of the 41 countries had implemented pro-cyclical policies –
for example cutting spending or tightening monetary policy -- that would be expected
to exacerbate an economic downturn. This new discussion paper responds to the IMF's
defense of its policies.

Abstract: Since the end of the 1970s, the United States has seen a dramatic
increase in economic inequality. While the United States has long been among
the most unequal of the world’s rich economies, the economic and social upheaval
that began in the 1970s was a striking departure from the movement toward greater
equality that began in the Great Depression, continued through World War II, and
was a central feature of the first 30 years of the postwar period. This is not
due to chance circumstances but is the direct result of a set of policies designed
first and foremost to increase inequality.

Abstract: The unemployment rate is expected to average 10.2 percent for 2010,
9.1 percent for 2011, and 7.3 percent for 2012. With this in mind, this Issue
Brief describes a job sharing tax credit, designed to provide a quick and
substantial boost to the economy. It would use tax dollars to pay firms to
shorten the typical workweek, while keeping pay constant. This should cause
employers to want to hire additional workers. A rough estimate of the impact of
this tax credit is between 1.3 and 2.7 million jobs created.

Title: Free Trade in Health Care: The Gains from Globalized Medicare and Medicaid
Author-Name: Dean Baker

Author-Name: Hye-Jin Rho
Creation-Date: 2009-10
Abstract: The huge gap between the cost of health care in the United States and
the cost in other countries with comparable health care outcomes suggests the
potential for substantial gains from trade. This paper describes one mechanism
for taking advantage of these gains – through a globalization of the country’s
Medicare and Medicaid programs. The projections in this paper suggest that the
country’s long-term budget situation would be substantially improved if
beneficiaries of these two programs over the age of 65 were allowed to take
advantage of the lower-cost health care available in other countries (that also
have higher life expectancies than the U.S.). This could also allow them to enjoy
much higher retirement incomes than they would otherwise receive.

Abstract: Two of the three leading health care reform proposals being considered

Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee’s reform legislation—include
sensibly designed “play-or-pay” provisions that require employers to pay an assessment
if they do not offer insurance to some or all of their employees. The third leading
health care reform proposal—the bill proposed by Sen. Max Baucus and currently under
consideration by the Senate Finance Committee—also includes a play-or-pay requirement,
but it is poorly designed and would be unfair to employers, harmful to employees,
and impose wasteful expenses on taxpayers.

output, cuts in social services, and political instability that have resulted from
the downturn. Instead, the governments’ responses to the downturn as well as IMF

Abstract: Disability is both a fundamental cause and consequence of income poverty.
The income-poverty rate for persons with disabilities is between two to three times

This paper argues that we need to have a broader view of what poverty is and also

Title: CBO Projects More Severe Downturn

Abstract: The new economic projections from the Congressional Budget Office show
the economy remaining well below its potential level of output until 2014. The
projections show the unemployment rate averaging 10.2 percent in 2010 and
gradually edging down to the long-term sustainable rate of 4.8 percent by 2014.
Over this 4 year period, the workforce will face a substantially higher risk of
unemployment or underemployment due to insufficient demand in the economy. This
paper highlights some of the main implications of CBO’s new economic projections.

Title: Hitting Bottom? An Updated Analysis of Rents and the Price of Housing in 100 Metropolitan Areas
Author-Name: Danilo Pelletiere

Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-08
Abstract: It has been two years since the housing bubble began to deflate. In
this time, home prices in major metropolitan areas have fallen more than 32.3
percent and the woes in the housing sector have spread to the broader economy.
Where is the housing market today? Have we hit bottom?

This paper, written by researchers from the Center for Economic and Policy Research
and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, finds that while most of the nation’s
metropolitan housing bubbles have deflated and many markets never had one to contend with,
there is the possibility of a persistent housing slump in the years ahead. An appropriate
response to this situation involves 1) stimulating demand for housing by acting
to lower unemployment and raise wages, 2) recognizing a leading role for rental
housing in federal foreclosure mitigation and neighborhood stabilization policy,
including allowing foreclosed homeowners to remain in their homes as renters
(Right to Rent), and 3) adequately funding the National Housing Trust Fund.

Title: The Gains from Right to Rent
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Author-Name: Hye Jin Rho
Creation-Date: 2009-07
Abstract: This paper calculates savings from renting compared with owning a
house purchased at the peak housing bubble years of 2006 or 2007 in 16 major
metropolitan areas. (The appendix includes calculations for 100 cities,
including these 16.) The analysis calculates the savings both before- and
after-tax, allowing readers to see the impact on ownership costs of the
mortgage interest and property tax deductions.

Many of the homeowners currently facing foreclosure would likely be able
to afford the market rent on their home. If Congress were to temporarily
alter the foreclosure laws to allow foreclosed homeowners to remain in their
homes as renters, it is likely that many would chose to take advantage of this
opportunity. This path would offer savings for former homeowners, as well as
help stabilize families and communities that are blighted by foreclosures. In
addition, Right to Rent offers the advantage that it could immediately benefit
all homeowners facing foreclosure without any bureaucracy and would require no
taxpayer dollars.

Title: The Right to Rent Plan
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-07
Abstract: This issue brief discusses a plan that would effectively deal with the
mounting problem of home foreclosures in this country.  The main point of the
plan is that those who are facing foreclosure should have the option to remain
in their home for a substantial period of time as renters.  There are also
numerous advantages in enacting Right to Rent legislation: it is simple, it
can take effect immediately, it requires no taxpayer dollars, and it creates
no new bureaucracy.

Title: The Alphabet Soup Explained: An Analysis of the Special Lending Facilities at the Federal Reserve
Author-Name: Matthew Sherman
Creation-Date: 2009-07
Abstract: This paper looks at the trends in activity at the Federal Reserve’s
newly-created special lending facilities, hoping to provide a better
understanding of their operation and significance within financial markets.
These facilities were created in response to the financial crisis and have
expanded the Fed's balance sheet by over $1 trillion in terms of total assets.
This sum is larger than the total price tag of the recent federal stimulus as
well as the bank bailout authorized by the TARP. Yet both of these government
responses have received enormously more public scrutiny than any of the actions
taken by the Federal Reserve.

Title: Costa Rica During the Global Recession: Fiscal Stimulus with Tight Monetary Policy
Author-Name: Jose Antonio Cordero
Creation-Date: 2009-07
Abstract: This paper shows that, in spite of a reasonably sized fiscal stimulus package,
Costa Rica’s economy continues on a downward path, partly because fiscal policy
is being offset by a tightening of monetary policy. The paper notes that the
International Monetary Fund has insisted that Costa Rica’s monetary policy
remain tight due to worries over inflation targets and a perceived risk of a
balance of payments crisis. However, the author notes that the IMF could help
prevent a balance of payments crisis through the provision of a credit line of
foreign currency, as it has done, for example, in Mexico – a vastly larger economy.
The paper also examines the government’s macroeconomic policies in recent years,
prior to the world recession, to see what alternative policies might have done better.

Abstract: From the early 1990s through the peak of the last business cycle,
relatively low U.S. unemployment rates seemed to make the United States a
model for the rest of the world’s economies. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
and other international organizations all praised the U.S. unemployment
performance and urged the rest of the world’s rich countries to emulate the
"flexibility" of the U.S. model.  However, this report shows that in the
current economic crisis, the U.S. unemployment rate ranks 4th to last among
the major OECD countries.

Abstract: This report finds that the U.S. is the only country among 22 countries
ranked highly in terms of economic and human development that does not guarantee
that workers receive paid sick days or paid sick leave. Under current U.S. labor
law, employers are not required to provide short-term paid sick days or longer-term
paid sick leave.  By relying solely on voluntary employer policies to provide
paid sick days or leave to employees, tens of millions of U.S. workers are without
paid sick days or leave. As a result, each year millions of American workers go
to work sick, lowering productivity and potentially spreading illness to their
coworkers and customers.

Creation-Date: 2009-05
Abstract: his issue brief looks at the likely costs to the U.S. Treasury from a
$108 billion increase in the U.S. contribution to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). The White House's Office of Management and Budget originally
proposed the $108 billion be scored at zero in the budget, and there are
indications that it may be scored at as little as $5 billion.

This analysis estimates the cost to the U.S. Treasury would be in the range
of $16.6 to $26.3 billion, based on the difference between the U.S. Treasury's
borrowing costs and interest received from the IMF. These estimates are
conservative and understate the true cost.

Creation-Date: 2009-05
Abstract: This report shows that the $787 billion included in the 2009 ARRA
will not have as much of an immediate effect on the economy as initially
anticipated. After subtracting the annual AMT patch and acounting for state
level spending and tax cuts, the full effect of federal stimulus will equal
a little more than 1 percent of GDP a year, falling far short of what is
needed to re-ignite the economy.  While the 2009 recovery act was a vital
first step towards restoring the nations economic foundation, this paper puts
some perspective on the immediate effects of the stimulus.

Title: Troubled Assets: The IMF's Latest Projections for Economic Growth in the Western Hemisphere

Abstract: This issue brief examines the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's)

It finds that for some countries – most notably Venezuela and Argentina – the
IMF’s projections inexplicably portend a prolonged negative impact of the current
world recession, even as countries harder-hit by the downturn, such as Mexico,
recover. In other cases, such as Haiti, the IMF projects a surprisingly big growth spurt.

Creation-Date: 2009-04
Abstract: This paper briefly reviews the IMF’s current practices and policy-making
in the context of a proposed quadrupling of IMF resources to $1 trillion dollars,
and a consequent increase in the Fund’s influence over economic policy-making in
developing countries. It finds that the IMF is still prescribing inappropriate
policies that could unnecessarily exacerbate economic downturns in a number of countries.

The paper concludes that these pro-cyclical policies can exacerbate the world
economic downturn.  Perhaps more importantly, the re-establishment of the IMF
as a major power in economic and decision-making in low-and-middle income
countries, with little or no voice for these countries in the IMF’s decision-making,
could have long-term implications for growth, development, and social indicators
in many countries. The authors propose some reforms in the areas of governance
and accountability to be attached of funding increases, in order to help prevent adverse outcomes.

Title: Pay for Play? Tax Credits for Paid Time Off
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-03
Abstract: Economists are increasingly coming to the recognition that the current
downturn is likely to be longer and more severe than they had expected at the time
the last stimulus package was approved in February.  As a result, there is likely
to be interest in additional stimulus in order to boost the economy and lower the
unemployment rate.

This paper briefly outlines a method for Congress to quickly boost demand in
the economy, while at the same time promoting important public ends: an employer
tax credit for paid time off. This paid time off can take the form of paid family
leave, paid sick days, paid vacation, or a shorter workweek. This tax credit can
both provide short-term stimulus and also provide an incentive to restructure
workplaces in ways that are more family friendly. It is possible that many
workplaces may leave in place changes made to take advantage of this tax credit
even after it has expired.

Creation-Date: 2009-03
Abstract: This report updates an earlier report from January of 2007, which
found a steep rise in illegal firings of pro-union workers in the 2000s relative
to the last half of the 1990s. It updates the index of the probability that a
pro-union worker will be fired in the course of a union election campaign,
using published data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). It also
takes into consideration the increase in card-check organizing campaigns that
began in the mid-1990s and adjusts the index for this factor.

By 2007, pro-union workers involved in union election campaigns faced about a
1.8 percent chance of being illegally fired during the course of the campaign.
If we assume that employers target union organizers and activists, and that
union organizers and activists make up about 10 percent of pro-union workers,
our estimates suggest that almost one-in-five union organizers or activists
can expect to be fired as a result of their activities in a union election
campaign.  Since 2000, illegal firings have  marred over one-in-four NLRB-sponsored
union elections, reaching 30 percent of elections in 2007.

Title: Is the U.S. Unemployment Rate Today Already as High as It Was in 1982?
Author-Name: John Schmitt
Author-Person: psc226
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-02
Abstract: In 1982, the United States experienced the highest annual unemployment
rate since the Great Depression – 9.7 percent. In principle, that rate is directly
comparable to the 8.1 percent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for February
2009, and suggests that current unemployment is still not as bad as it was in 1982.

The official unemployment rate, however, masks two important differences between
the unemployment rate in 1982 and today. The first difference is demographic.
In 1982, the US population was substantially younger than it is today. Even in
an otherwise identical economy, we would expect a younger population to have a
higher unemployment rate than an older population would. The second difference
is statistical. The main government survey used to measure the unemployment rate –
the Current Population Survey (CPS) reaches a smaller share of the population
today than it did in 1982, and is especially likely to miss people who are not
employed. As a result, the official unemployment rate understates the unemployment
rate relative to 1982.

Abstract: This paper makes the case for a third stimulus package to in the
face of economic indicators signaling that the economy is in a deeper downturn
than was expected based on previous projections. Specifically, the report calls
for an employer tax-credit for extending health care coverage and another per
worker employer tax credit for increasing paid time off from work. The author
also makes the case for a housing policy centered on the stabilization of prices
in non-bubble and deflated markets rather than applying the same efforts on
markets that remain at bubble inflated levels. Finally, the paper argues that
the dollar must be allowed to fall in order to adjust trade imbalances that
are compounding the U.S. economic crisis caused by the collapse of the housing market.

Author-Name: Jason Walsh
Creation-Date: 2009-03
Abstract: The $787 billion recovery package marks a big, bold, and historic
investment in creating green jobs and building more equitable communities. The
package invests nearly $100 billion in funding for transportation and
infrastructure, $48 billion in investments in job training and education,
$41 billion for energy-related programs, and $20 billion in tax incentives
for renewable energy.

But without substantial advocacy from local and state groups, these historic
federal investments may not end up in the communities that need them most. The
in-depth guide offers tangible, up-to-date information and ideas for using and
securing recovery dollars to help expand opportunity in low-income communities
and communities of color.

The guide is a first step in what will be a vital nationwide effort to ensure
the recovery package helps all communities rise stronger than ever from this
economic crisis, and that community-based organizations are at the forefront
in crafting a green, equitable recovery.

Creation-Date: 2009-02
Abstract: This report builds upon previous CEPR projections to more accurately
describe the current wealth prospects for the baby boom cohorts aged 45 to 54
and 55 to 64. The severity of the housing market meltdown, coupled with the
recent collapse of the stock market, has had a severe negative impact on the
wealth of these cohorts. Using data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance
and the November 2008 Case-Shiller 20 City Price Index, the authors create
three possible scenarios for baby boomer wealth and find these households will
enter retirement with little wealth beyond Social Security. For each cohort in
2004 and 2009, the paper analyzes net worth, financial assets, equity in real
estate, percent of households in each cohort who will need cash to close on
their primary residence, net worth of homeowners, net worth of non-homeowners,
and the percent of homeowners who would need cash to close on their primary residence.

Abstract: This paper looks briefly at the recent inflation experiences of ten
Latin American countries: Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, Peru,
Ecuador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Bolivia. The authors construct
a core inflation index (excluding food and energy), and look at three-month
changes in both headline and core inflation.

The paper focuses on the increase in inflation from April 2007 to July 2008,
driven by a surge in food and energy prices worldwide. These prices have since
dropped considerably. The authors conclude that macroeconomic policy that does
not take into account the temporary nature of these price shocks may result in
an unnecessary slowing of growth, with reduced output and employment.

Title: Leave No Child Behind: A Quick Take on How Congress Should Restructure
the Child Tax Credit to More Fairly Value Families and Reduce Inequality
Author-Name: Shawn Fremstad
Author-Person: pfr147
Creation-Date: 2009-01
Abstract: This issue brief examines the Child Tax Credit (CTC) in its current
form and finds that many of the families with children most in need of
additional assistance receive no or little benefit from the credit. The paper
analyzes a restructuring of the present CTC put forth by the Brookings Institute
and goes on to propose amending the CTC to make it both more inclusive and
progressive.

Title: Spending Versus Tax Cuts: Who Pays the Cost of Political Compromise?
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2009-01
Abstract: President Obama and the Democratic leadership will undoubtedly have to
make some political compromises in order to get a stimulus package through
Congress. However, it is important to keep in mind that there will be real
costs associated with these compromises insofar as they result in a less
effective stimulus package. A less effective package will mean less economic
growth, which will, in turn, mean that fewer people will have jobs.
Keywords: economic crisis, economic stimulus, fiscal stimulus
