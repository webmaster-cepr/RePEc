Title: Labor Markets and Economic Inequality in the United States Since the
 End of the 1970s
Author-Name: John Schmitt 
Author-Person: psc226
Creation-Date: 2005-04
Language: en
Abstract: By most measures, the United States is the most unequal of the
 world's advanced capitalist economies, and inequality has increased
 substantially over the past 30 years. This article documents trends in the
 inequality of three key economic distributions-- hourly earnings, annual
 incomes, and net wealth--and relates these developments to changes in economic
 and social policy over the past three decades. The primary cause of high and
 rising inequality is the systematic erosion of the bargaining power of lower-
 and middle-income workers relative to their employers, reflected in the erosion
 of the real value of the minimum wage, the decline in unions, widescale
 deregulation of industries such as airlines and trucking, the privatization
 and outsourcing of many state and local government activities, increasing
 international competition, and periods of restrictive macroeconomic policy.

Abstract: This paper calculated rates of return for wage earners corresponding
