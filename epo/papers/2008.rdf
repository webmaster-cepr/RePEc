Title: Will Workers Survive State Budget Belt-Tightening?

Creation-Date: 2008-12
Abstract: As state governments face budget gaps of tens of billions of dollars
in FY2009 and FY2010, this issue brief calculates the potential detrimental
effects of state budget cuts on unemployment.  While Congress considers a
national economic recovery package, this issue brief highlights the fact
that aid to state and local governments could help avoid spending cuts and
ensuing job losses.

Title: Measuring Poverty and Economic Inclusion: The Current Poverty Measure, the NAS Alternative, and the Case for a Truly New Approach
Author-Name: Shawn Fremstad
Author-Person: pfr147
Creation-Date: 2008-12
Abstract: This report examines the current U.S. poverty measure and finds that
it has failed to keep up with public consensus on the minimum amount of income
needed to “get along” in the United States in the 21st Century. The author then
examines a potential approach to revising the measure, based on recommendations
made by a National Academy of Sciences panel in 1995, that improves in some ways
on the current measure, but has serious limitations of its own that require
further research before it is adopted. Moreover, the NAS approach results in a
poverty measure that would remain far below the public’s get-along level. This
report concludes by suggesting a truly new approach that the incoming Administration
should adopt- a “tiered” poverty and economic-inclusion measure that is modeled on
the child poverty measure adopted in 2003 by the United Kingdom.

Title: The Benefits of a Financial Transactions Tax
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2008-12
Abstract: The recent economic turmoil has generated renewed interest in a
financial transactions tax (FTT). While such a tax will be vigorously opposed
by the financial industry, it offers a very attractive mechanism for raising
revenue that is arguably efficiency-enhancing. Calculations based on 2000
trading volumes showed that a set of scaled transactions taxes, imposed on
transfers of stock and other financial assets, could raise more than $100
billion a year, even assuming large reductions in trading volume.

Budget Office to analyze the savings in prescription drug spending for seniors
as a result of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
Act of 2003 (MMA). The results show that the 1st income quintile of seniors
experienced a fall in the rate of expenditures for prescription drugs and the
2nd income quintile saw a slowing of the rate of increase in expenditures.
However, senior households in the middle- and upper-income quintiles saw a
rise in expenditures for prescription drugs.

Title: The Key to Stabilizing House Prices: Bring Them Down
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2008-12
Abstract: This report states that bringing about the rapid adjustment of house
prices to trend levels is the best means of returning stability to the housing
market. The paper also calls for the restriction of GSE capital in bubble-inflated
markets, with the intent of forcing house prices in these areas to return to
trend level. The removal of capital from bubble markets and the consequent
infusion of loans into non-bubble markets would stabilize prices in these
areas, thus preventing a downward price spiral and overshooting of trend-level
prices on the negative side. The report also advocates mortgage appraisal based
on a price-to-rent ratio of 15 to 1. As well, the paper suggests giving families
facing foreclosure the right to rent their homes both to keep them in their
houses and offer banks real incentives to avoid foreclosure.

Creation-Date: 2008-11
Abstract: This paper looks at Venezuela’s export revenue, imports, and trade and
current account balances under a range of oil price outcomes for the next two
years. It finds that Venezuela would run large current account surpluses for
prices between $60-90 per barrel, and would even run a small surplus with
prices at $50 per barrel. (Most oil industry estimates for the next two years
are in the range of $80-90 per barrel). The authors conclude that Venezuela is
unlikely to run into foreign exchange constraints in the foreseeable future,
and can pursue expansionary fiscal policies to counter any economic downturn.

Abstract: This report looks at Argentina’s current debt, fiscal, and overall
economic situation to see if there is justification for concerns that Argentina
is facing serious economic problems that could lead to a default on its
sovereign debt. The Argentine economy has grown more than 60 percent since
its recovery began six years ago, has trade and current account surpluses,
and has declining levels of debt relative to GDP and other indicators. It
also has a large amount of reserves relative to potential debt financing
shortfalls. The paper finds that there is little or no basis for the fear
that Argentina might default on its sovereign debt at any time in the
foreseeable future, or indeed even the more distant future.

comparing the state of the economy in 2000 and 2008. We use 25 indicators of

indicators are worse in 2008 than they were in 2000. Even after we limit
comparisons to similar points across the business cycle, the same 23
indicators were worse at the most recent business-cycle peak (2007) than they were in 2000.

Abstract: This report updates CEPR's May 2008 report titled "Ownership, Rental
Costs and the Prospects of Building Home Equity: An Analysis of 100 Metropolitan
Areas," which compared the ownership and rental costs in 100 major U.S.
metropolitan areas and projected the potential for a first-time homebuyer in
those cities to accumulate home equity.  Since the publication of that paper,
housing prices have continued their steep descent in much of the country and
rents have risen modestly.  The study shows that recent price declines indicate
many communities are moving back toward the historical track of modest equity
increases for homebuyers. The findings point out that is still unwise for policy
makers to attempt to directly intervene in housing markets to maintain what are
historically unprecedented high home prices.

Abstract: This paper examines television news coverage of proposed drilling for
oil in environmentally sensitive zones in the United States. It finds that these
broadcasts almost completely ignored data, and conclusions, from the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency (EIA). The EIA finds that
the benefits from such drilling would be too small to have a significant
effect on the price of oil. There is no legitimate reason for this omission
in the media. Just as economic reporting regularly uses data (unemployment,
inflation, GDP, trade) from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, or Bureau
of Labor Statistics, reporting on energy relies on data from the EIA.

Abstract: This report presents several proposals designed to address the nation’s
current economic slowdown. To blunt the effects of this downturn and provide
immediate relief, the authors suggest a second stimulus package. Proposals for
the package include an expanded tax credit for homes and businesses to make
energy conserving renovations, subsidies for state and local governments to
reduce fares on public transportation, matching grants to state and local
governments to invest in energy conserving renovations, grants to state and
local governments so that they will not be forced to raise taxes and/or layoff
workers and cut services in the middle of a downturn, additional payments to
low- and moderate-income households through programs such as Food Stamps,
School Lunches and the Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance Program to
make it easier for families to cope with rising food and energy prices,
modernization of the unemployment insurance system and further extension of
the benefit period. To promote continued, sustained growth, the paper suggests
policies that will require restructuring the U.S. economy to protect homeowners,
reel in financial markets, and to restore some balance to our work and family
commitments.

Abstract: This paper extrapolates from data from the 2004 Survey of Consumer

alternative scenarios. The first scenario assumes that real house prices fall
no further than their level as of March 2008. The second scenario assumes that
real house prices fall an additional 10 percent as a 2009 average. The third
scenario assumes that real house prices fall an additional 20 percent for a
2009 average. The projections show that the vast majority of families will
see a substantial reduction in wealth by 2009 in any of these scenarios and
that the cohorts just approaching retirement will have very little to support
themselves in retirement other than their Social Security. The projections also
show that a large number of families will have little or no equity in their
homes in 2009.

Abstract: This paper challenges the conclusions of an econometric analysis by
Daniel Ortega and Francisco Rodríguez on the effects on literacy of the Misión
Robinson program in Venezuela. Their analysis concludes "most of our estimates
of program impact represent qualitatively small and rarely statistically
significant effects of Robinson, while some point estimates are actually negative."

This CEPR paper shows that the econometric analysis used by Ortega and Rodríguez
does not provide statistical evidence regarding the size of the Misión Robinson
national literacy program in Venezuela, partly because the Household Survey
data on which the authors relied are too crude a measure to make such an
estimate. In addition, the statistical tests the authors used are not appropriate
to test (falsify) the hypothesis that the program was a large-scale program.

Abstract: This report compares the ownership and rental costs in 100 major U.S.
metropolitan areas. Extending the work from a previous CEPR/NLIHC paper, "The
Cost of Maintaining Ownership in the Current Crisis: Comparisons in 20 Cities,"
this study, while demonstrating the wide diversity in housing markets across the
nation, finds that in many areas, homeownership costs are in line with rental
costs.  In these areas, it is practical and desirable to focus on policies that
keep homeowners in their homes. The report goes on to show that in bubble-inflated
markets, however, homeownership is not only a costly and risky proposition, but
continuing price declines mean that homeowners will not accrue any equity. The
authors suggest that policy makers should be sure to consider affordable rental
options as part of the solution when drafting proposals to help households in
these markets.

Title: How Not to Attack an Economist (and an Economy): Getting the Numbers Right
Author-Name: Mark Weisbrot
Author-Person: pwe148
Creation-Date: 2008-04
Abstract: This paper continues a debate over the extent of economic and social
progress in Venezuela that began with an article in the March/April 2008 issue
of Foreign Affairs. This article argued that “a close look at the evidence
reveals just how much Chávez's 'revolution' has hurt Venezuela's economy --
and that the poor are hurting most of all.” CEPR responded with “An Empty
Research Agenda: The Creation of Myths About Contemporary Venezuela,” showing
that the main allegations of the article were wrong. The author of the Foreign
Affairs article, economist Francisco Rodriguez, then responded with an Economics
Working Paper at Wesleyan University, which defended his original analysis.

The current paper demonstrates that Rodriguez's assertions in his response are
almost all without merit.  His argument that inequality has increased during
the Chávez years is contradicted by the best available data (in fact these data
show a reduction in inequality). His claim that the amount of poverty reduction
in Venezuela during the last four years, relative to its economic growth,
compares unfavorably to other countries is clearly wrong; in fact, Venezuela's
poverty reduction has been much better than the vast majority of countries for
the amount of growth that it has had. His argument that the Chávez government
did not demonstrate any change of priorities with regard to public spending is
wrong and misleading and his assertion that Venezuela's literacy program has
not had any distinguishable effect on literacy cannot be demonstrated from the
data that he uses.

Title: The Benefits and Savings of Publicly-Funded Clinical Trials of Prescription Drugs
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2008-03
Abstract: This paper proposes publicly funding prescription drug trials as an
alternative to the present system wherein pharmaceutical companies often finance
and conduct tests of their drugs themselves.  The report posits that in
addition to substantial savings for the government, independent companies
working under long-term federal contracts would result in full and accurate
disclosure of the results of drug testing.

Creation-Date: 2008-03
Abstract: This paper shows that the U.S.'s biggest trading partners in the
Americas will likely see a significant loss in exports and GDP as the U.S.
economy slows. Countries less reliant on the U.S. market will not be as
negatively impacted.

The paper makes two sets of projections for the decline in exports countries in
the Americas may experience. The low-adjustment scenario assumes that the U.S.
trade deficit falls from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2007 to 3.0 percent of GDP in
2010. The high adjustment scenario assumes that the U.S. trade deficit falls
back to 1.0 percent of GDP by 2010. The paper finds that the countries that
will likely suffer most as the result of a reduction in U.S. imports are the
same countries with which the United States has implemented “free trade”
agreements in recent decades, including the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and the Dominican
Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), which includes
the United States along with Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua,
Honduras, and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, countries that are less
dependent on the United States, or more reliant on domestic demand, will
see smaller impacts of the U.S. recession on their exports and national GDP.

Title: Subprime Rescue Plans: Backdoor Bank Bailouts
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2008-03
Abstract: This report analyzes recent proposals suggesting that the government
buy up or guarantee bad mortgage debt in an attempt to slow the increasing
number of foreclosures the nation has seen in the wake of the housing market's
meltdown. The study, which focuses on the plan put forth by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, shows that banks and mortgage holders end up being the true
beneficiaries of such plans at the expense of taxpayers and with few gains
for the majority of homeowners currently facing foreclosure.

Abstract: This report details the sharp decline in African-American employment
in manufacturing and in African-American unionization rates. The study, which
analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, shows
that the share of American workers in unions continues to fall, but unionization
rates for African-Americans have declined more sharply than for the rest of the
workforce.

Abstract: This research brief summarizes recent findings by the Center for
Economic and Policy Research on job quality and workers' economic security.
Using a rigorous methodology that improves on other more standard measures of
economic security, we find that one in five Americans in working families have
income below a minimum middle-class budget standard for the area in which they
live. The authors argue this is the result of a frayed social contract that
must be updated so that more workers can move into the middle class. The report
concludes with proposals that would strengthen labor market institutions,
expand work supports for families in the middle and working classes, and
provide workers, particularly those in low- and moderate-wage jobs, with
more opportunities to improve their skills and education throughout their lifetimes.

Creation-Date: 2008-01
Abstract: This report uses the past three recessions of the early 1980s, early
1990s and early 2000s to project the effects of a recession in 2008. The report
finds that such a recession would result in a significant rise in unemployment
and the poverty rate along with a significant decrease in the employment rate
and the median family income. These effects would be felt long after financial
markets begin to recover with workers feeling the negative effects of the
recession for the next three to four years.

Creation-Date: 2008-01
Abstract: This issue brief finds that a forecast by Oxford Economics suggesting
that the United Kingdom’s living standards will exceed those of the U.S. in 2008
is misleading. CEPR found that the forecast relies on a basic misunderstanding
of standard methods of comparing international standards of living. Using the
appropriate economic method, in 2008, the GDP per capita of the United States
will exceed that of the United Kingdom by almost 19 percent.
