Title: Working Paper: State Payroll Taxes: A Tool for States to Circumvent the Republican Tax Plan
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-02
Abstract: The new tax law sharply limits the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) when calculating federal taxes by capping the deduction at $10,000. While this will not affect most taxpayers, it will affect a substantial number of taxpayers in relatively high tax states like California and New York. This paper suggests an employer-side payroll tax as a tool that states can use to shield most of the tax revenue that otherwise would have been collected through formerly deductible income or sales taxes.

Title: Broken: The Confirmation Process of Trump’s Unvetted Cabinet
Author-Name: Jeff Hauser

Creation-Date: 2018-03
Abstract: Amidst growing interest in the interim security clearances given to Rob Porter, Jared Kushner, and other senior White House staff, it is worth widening the scope of inquiry. 

This paper examines whether the Trump Administration successfully pressured the FBI and Senate into inadequate and overly hasty background checks on Cabinet officers. The paper details the breakdown in getting information to the FBI and Senate, and asks why that occurred.

Title: Does Tax Deductibility Affect CEO Pay? The Case of the Health Insurance Industry

Abstract: This paper tests whether pay fell for CEOs at health insurers in the years after the ACA deductibility cap went into effect. We control for revenue growth, profit growth, increase in market value, and other variables likely to affect CEO pay. Our key findings are:

There is no evidence that limiting the deductibility of CEO pay for health insurers lowered this pay relative to other industries, after controlling for other determinants of pay.

The failure of reduced deductibility to slow growth in CEO pay in the health insurance sector relative to other sectors means that the TCJA provisions are unlikely to significantly affect CEO pay more widely.

The assertion that rapid growth in CEO pay in recent decades has simply reflected shareholders rationally rewarding excellent performance by executives is flawed. It can hardly be rational for shareholders to ignore tax changes that make CEOs significantly more expensive to them. Instead, shareholders’ failure to respond to the increasing expense of CEO pay strongly supports the view that weaknesses in corporate governance have failed to discipline the growth of CEO pay.

To restrain growth in CEO pay we need reforms to improve corporate governance and give shareholders more power over corporate executives.

Title: The Availability of Data from Clinical Trials: The Case of Crohn's Disease

Abstract: The United States spent an estimated $540 billion on prescription drugs and medical equipment in 2017 ($450 billion on prescription drugs alone).  Clinical trials which evaluate prescription drugs and new devices prior to their entrance on the market are usually financed and sometimes even carried out by the company holding the intellectual property rights to the technology in question. This is problematic for several reasons. There is an obvious incentive to conceal or underreport trial data which could be harmful to a drug’s sales potential or reputation. 

Our study seeks to briefly characterize the data made available through ClinicalTrials.gov in order to better understand what information is available to prescribers and investigators not involved in the marketing of the drug or device. In doing so, we underscore the potentially enormous value of publicly funding clinical trials in terms of both patient safety and economic cost.

Title: Measuring the Inflation Rate: Is Housing Different?
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-06
Abstract: This paper argues that the Federal Reserve should also consider removing the shelter component from the core inflation indexes it uses in assessing the state of the economy. The reason is that the shelter component is also not moved by the same dynamics as most of the items in the indices. This has not generally mattered in prior years, since inflation in the shelter components has not differed much from the inflation rate in the rest of the core. However, this is no longer true. Over the last four years, a core inflation rate that excludes shelter would be more than 0.5 percentage points lower than the standard core in the CPI and more than 0.3 percentage points lower in the PCE.

Abstract: The Pact for Mexico pledged to institute policies that would usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for Mexico, through the implementation of a series of structural reforms. The timeline for implementation of the proposed reforms extended to the second semester of 2018.

This paper examines whether there has been progress toward the Pact’s goals since it was signed; and whether any measures taken since then — including current economic policies — are likely to help Mexico break out of its long economic slump and forge a different path toward economic and social progress.

Five years into the Pact for Mexico, it is clear from the available data that the Pact’s promises to launch a new era of economic and social progress have not begun to materialize. The authors conclude that the country’s persistent sluggish growth, poverty, and inequality are rooted in a set of important economic policy choices that have been made consistently for a long time.

Title: The Housing Bubble and the Great Recession: Ten Years Later
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-09
Abstract: It is ten years since we were at the peak of the financial crisis — the collapse of Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. This sent tremors throughout the world, and media outlets began talking about a return of the Great Depression. While the fear generated by politicians and media was able to get enough support for saving the financial industry, the country was left to deal with the painful fallout from a collapsed housing bubble. Millions lost their homes and jobs. Even a decade later, by some measures, most notably prime-age employment rates, the labor market has still not recovered.

This discussion makes several points concerning the bubble and its collapse. First and foremost, it argues that the primary story of the downturn was a collapsed housing bubble, not the financial crisis. Prior to the downturn, the housing bubble had been driving the economy, pushing residential construction to record levels as a share of GDP. The housing wealth effect also led to a consumption boom. The saving rate reached a record low. When the bubble burst, it was inevitable that these sources of demand would disappear and there were no easy options for replacing them, except very large government budget deficits.

Title: Working Paper: Is Intellectual Property the Root of All Evil? Patents, Copyrights, and Inequality
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-10
Abstract: This paper raises three issues on the relationship between intellectual property and inequality. The first is a simple logical point. Patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property are public policy. They are not facts given to us by the world or the structure of technology somehow. While this point should be self-evident, it is rarely noted in discussions of inequality or ways to address it.
