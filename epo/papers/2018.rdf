Title: Working Paper: State Payroll Taxes: A Tool for States to Circumvent the Republican Tax Plan
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-02
Abstract: The new tax law sharply limits the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) when calculating federal taxes by capping the deduction at $10,000. While this will not affect most taxpayers, it will affect a substantial number of taxpayers in relatively high tax states like California and New York. This paper suggests an employer-side payroll tax as a tool that states can use to shield most of the tax revenue that otherwise would have been collected through formerly deductible income or sales taxes.

Title: Broken: The Confirmation Process of Trump’s Unvetted Cabinet
Author-Name: Jeff Hauser

Creation-Date: 2018-03
Abstract: Amidst growing interest in the interim security clearances given to Rob Porter, Jared Kushner, and other senior White House staff, it is worth widening the scope of inquiry. 

This paper examines whether the Trump Administration successfully pressured the FBI and Senate into inadequate and overly hasty background checks on Cabinet officers. The paper details the breakdown in getting information to the FBI and Senate, and asks why that occurred.

Title: Does Tax Deductibility Affect CEO Pay? The Case of the Health Insurance Industry

Abstract: This paper tests whether pay fell for CEOs at health insurers in the years after the ACA deductibility cap went into effect. We control for revenue growth, profit growth, increase in market value, and other variables likely to affect CEO pay. Our key findings are:

There is no evidence that limiting the deductibility of CEO pay for health insurers lowered this pay relative to other industries, after controlling for other determinants of pay.

The failure of reduced deductibility to slow growth in CEO pay in the health insurance sector relative to other sectors means that the TCJA provisions are unlikely to significantly affect CEO pay more widely.

The assertion that rapid growth in CEO pay in recent decades has simply reflected shareholders rationally rewarding excellent performance by executives is flawed. It can hardly be rational for shareholders to ignore tax changes that make CEOs significantly more expensive to them. Instead, shareholders’ failure to respond to the increasing expense of CEO pay strongly supports the view that weaknesses in corporate governance have failed to discipline the growth of CEO pay.

To restrain growth in CEO pay we need reforms to improve corporate governance and give shareholders more power over corporate executives.

Title: The Availability of Data from Clinical Trials: The Case of Crohn's Disease

Abstract: The United States spent an estimated $540 billion on prescription drugs and medical equipment in 2017 ($450 billion on prescription drugs alone).  Clinical trials which evaluate prescription drugs and new devices prior to their entrance on the market are usually financed and sometimes even carried out by the company holding the intellectual property rights to the technology in question. This is problematic for several reasons. There is an obvious incentive to conceal or underreport trial data which could be harmful to a drug’s sales potential or reputation. 

Our study seeks to briefly characterize the data made available through ClinicalTrials.gov in order to better understand what information is available to prescribers and investigators not involved in the marketing of the drug or device. In doing so, we underscore the potentially enormous value of publicly funding clinical trials in terms of both patient safety and economic cost.
