Title: Working Paper: State Payroll Taxes: A Tool for States to Circumvent the Republican Tax Plan
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2018-02
Abstract: The new tax law sharply limits the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) when calculating federal taxes by capping the deduction at $10,000. While this will not affect most taxpayers, it will affect a substantial number of taxpayers in relatively high tax states like California and New York. This paper suggests an employer-side payroll tax as a tool that states can use to shield most of the tax revenue that otherwise would have been collected through formerly deductible income or sales taxes.

Abstract: Amidst growing interest in the interim security clearances given to Rob Porter, Jared Kushner, and other senior White House staff, it is worth widening the scope of inquiry. 

This paper examines whether the Trump Administration successfully pressured the FBI and Senate into inadequate and overly hasty background checks on Cabinet officers. The paper details the breakdown in getting information to the FBI and Senate, and asks why that occurred.
