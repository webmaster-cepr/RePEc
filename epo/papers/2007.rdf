Title: Dropping the Ax: Illegal Firings During Union Election Campaigns

Abstract: This report finds a steep rise in illegal firings of pro-union
 workers in the 2000s relative to the last half of the 1990s. It uses
 published data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to update an
 index of the probability that a pro-union worker will be fired in the
 course of a union election campaign.

 By 2005, pro-union workers involved in union election campaigns faced about
 a 1.8 percent chance of being illegally fired during the course of the
 campaign. If we assume that employers target union organizers and activists,
 and that union organizers and activists make up about 10 percent of
 pro-union workers, our estimates suggest that almost one-in-five union
 organizers or activists can expect to be fired as a result of their
 activities in a union election campaign.

Title: Behind the Gap Between Productivity and Wage Growth
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2007-02
Language: en
Abstract: Much has been written in this business cycle regarding the rapid
 increases in productivity and the stagnant growth in wages.  From the
 peak of the last business cycle in the first quarter of 2001 to the second
 quarter of 2006, productivity increased by 17.9 percent, an average growth
 rate of 3.2 percent per year. But real wages have barely moved, with the
 average hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory workers increasing by
 just 1.2 percent, an average annual growth rate of just over 0.2 percent.
 This report explores the forces behind this difference.  It looks at
 cyclical trends in labor and capital income, and the difference between
 gross and net productivity.

Abstract: This report details the sharp decline in African-American employment
 in manufacturing and the even sharper decline in African-American
 unionization rates. The study, which analyzed data from the U.S. Census
 Bureau's Current Population Survey, shows that the share of American
 workers in unions continues to fall, but unionization rates for
 African-Americans have declined more sharply than for the rest of the
 workforce.

Title: Stagnation in the Drug Development Process: Are Patents the Problem?
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2007-03
Language: en
Abstract: The rate of new drug development has stagnated, in spite of large 
 increases in both private and public sector spending on biomedical research.
 The flip side of slower progress is higher drug costs. The cost of 
 developing new drugs has been rising at an average real rate of more than
 7 percent since 1987. This report considers the ways in which government
 patent monopolies distort incentives so that pharmaceutical companies may
 not opt to minimize research costs. It documents some of the perverse
 incentives created by patent monopolies in drugs.

Title: Celebrating Pork: The Dubious Success of the Medicare Drug Benefit
 Health Insurance for the Elderly
Author-Name: Dean Baker
Author-Person: pba441
Creation-Date: 2007-03
Language: en
Abstract: Projected costs for Medicare Part D have been revised downward, 
 causing some analysts to claim that the program has proven itself a
 success. This report explores the factors behind the lower cost projections 
 and reaches far different conclusions.  It finds two main reasons: 1) a 
 slowdown in the rate of growth in drug prices that preceded the introduction
 of the benefit; and 2) fewer people are expected to enroll in the program. 
 The report recommends changes to the program that could save $30 billion a 
 year.

Abstract: Over 40 million jobs in the United States - about 1 in 3 - pay low 
 wages ($11.11 per hour or less) and often do not offer employment benefits
 like health insurance, retirement savings accounts, paid sick days or family
 leave. These low-wage jobs are replacing jobs that have historically
 supported a broad middle class.  This report provides a clear and sobering
 picture of the low-wage labor market through analysis of labor market data,
 including: downward wage trends over time, poor work conditions, largest
 occupations, and declining mobility. The authors used a social inclusion
 definition of low-wage work that allows for comparison among jobs in the
 United States.

Title: Political Forecasting? The IMF's Flawed Growth Projections for Argentina and Venezuela

Abstract: This report examines the International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
 projections for economic growth for Argentina and Venezuela in recent years.
 It shows that the IMF consistently made large errors in overestimating
 Argentina's GDP growth for the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, during the country's
 1998-2002 depression, and large underestimates for the years 2003-2006, as
 Argentina's economy grew rapidly. The paper also notes the IMF's repeated
 large errors in underestimating Venezuela's GDP growth for the years since
 2004.

Title: The Productivity to Paycheck Gap: What the Data Show
Author-Name: Dean Baker

Creation-Date: 2007-04
Language: en
Abstract: This report makes a series of adjustments to the most common measure
 of U.S. productivity growth (i.e., non-farm business sector) as well as to
 measures of wage growth, to determine the extent to which lagging wages can be
 blamed on weak productivity growth vs. income redistribution. Weak wage growth
 between 1973 and 2006 has generally been attributed to a redistribution of
 income from typical workers to higher paid workers. However, the report shows
 that, along with a redistribution of income, lagging wage growth has also been
 caused by slow productivity growth.

Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive look at how Argentina managed a
 remarkable economic recovery from its collapse in 2001. The authors show how
 the Argentine government's policy of targeting a stable and competitive real
 exchange rate was crucial to the country's economic recovery. They also
 analyze the various sources of aggregate demand and government revenue in
 different phases of the expansion. In addition to the crucial role of the
 exchange rate, the authors look at other policies - such as an export tax,
 capital controls, and the default on much of the country's sovereign debt -
 which were met with disapproval by many economists and other commentators but
 played an important role in the recovery.
