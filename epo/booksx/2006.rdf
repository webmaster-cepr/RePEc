Abstract: In his new book, economist Dean Baker debunks the myth that
 conservatives favor the market over government intervention. In fact,
 conservatives rely on a range of "nanny state" policies that ensure the 
 rich get richer while leaving most Americans worse off. It's time for the
 rules to change. Sound economic policy should harness the market in ways
 that produce desirable social outcomes -- decent wages, good jobs and
 affordable health care.
