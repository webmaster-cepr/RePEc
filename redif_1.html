<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p>
This specification describes version 1 of the Research Documents
Information Format (ReDIF). ReDIF version 1 will be referred to as
ReDIF throughout. ReDIF is a metadata format to describe the output
aspects of academic disciplines. But that we mean the scientific
documents that are produced, the channels through which they are made
public, the authors who produce the documents and the editors who
control the output channels, etc as well as the institutions that
support this process.  ReDIF does not aim at a very elaborate
description of these items. Its overriding design goal is
simplicity. It is aimed primarily for the use by academics as a
self-documentation tool. The idea is that if academics can make a
better documentation of their work themselves, then the need for
expensive intermediation between academics is reduced.  ReDIF is
supposed to be understood and deployed by people with no formal
cataloging training.
</p>

<p>
ReDIF is shipped with software--written in Perl--that allows to read
and validate ReDIF data.  This software is available at <a href="http://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-Perl">http://openlib.org/acmes/root/soft/ReDIF-Perl</a>.
For example, any date has to be of the form
<em>yyyy-mm-dd</em>. <code>1999-07</code> is a valid date, whereas
<code>Juillet 1999</code> is not a valid date. Therefore ReDIF is well
suited for the decentralized maintenance of metadata. The validating
software will make sure that only data that are syntactically correct
will be passed on to user services.  When subsequent versions will
extend the capabilities of version 1 the data of version 1 will still
be able to be understood by processing software that will implement
future versions.
</p>

<p>ReDIF is a <em>relational</em> metadata format. Each record has an
identifier, also called a "handle". Elements in one record may use the
identifier of another record. This allows elements to refer to other
elements. A simple example should be sufficient. An author may have
written several papers. She would like to have her email available
within the data for each paper. But if the email address changes,
there are changes required to all the records for all papers that the
author has written. That is cumbersome. Instead, it is better to group
all the personal data into one record, and use the handle of that
record whenever personal data is required. The email address then only
needs to be changed at one place. ReDIF explicitly allows for that.
</p>

<p>In order to implement this handle structure, some human effort is
required. This effort is being carried out by a group of people that
we refer to as the "authority" in the following. <a href="http://www.repec.org/">RePEc</a> is a well-know authority that
uses ReDIF.
</p>

<h2>2. The ReDIF templates</h2>

<h3>2.1. The template types</h3>

<p>ReDIF allows to describe things in the world that are important to
the work of an academic discipline. We will use the word "items" to
refer to any such things. ReDIF allows to catalogue three classes of
items.  First there are <em>resources</em>. A resource is either a
digital string of information or anything that can be digitized. A
book for example may not be digital but can be digitized, and
therefore it is a resource.  A second group of items are
<em>tangibles</em>. These are objects of descriptions that can not be
digitized. A person for example falls into that category.  Finally,
there are collections. These are manifolds that have a mixed nature
that makes it difficult to decide whether they are tangibles or
resources. In the following table, we list the items, the version of
the ReDIF template that describes it, a description of the item, and
finally the class of the item.
</p>

<h3>2.2. The ReDIF syntax</h3>

<p>ReDIF splits all the information concerning an item into a set of
data elements. By "data element" we mean an elementary piece of
information that we do not wish to split further. The whole set of
data elements that describe an item forms the bibliographic record or
"template" of this item. "Field" are is a synonym for a "data
element". We use in the following.
</p>

<p>The ReDIF templates aim to compromise between human and machine
readability. The general syntax for a field is
</p>

<p><em>field_name</em><code>:  </code><em>field value</em>
</p>

<p>where <em>field_name</em> would for example be
<code>Author-Workplace-Phone</code> and <em>field value</em> would be
<code>+44 (0)1483 876958</code>.  Of course we could split the
telephone number into an international dialing code, a city code and a
local code, but that would go beyond what our data is actually needed
for.  The field name must be separated from the field value by a colon
and optional whitespace. By a whitespace we mean a space character or
a tabulation character or 
a newline character or a carriage return character
or any combination of those.
</p>

<p>Field names may contain only alphanumeric characters, the hyphen
<code>-</code> and the hash sign <code>#</code>. No embedded spaces
are allowed. Field names are case insensitive.  Any field that starts
with <code>X-</code> is considered to be local. The parsing software
will read it but make no checks on the values.
</p>

<p>Any field value may be continued (or even started)
on the next line by adding a whitespace at the beginning of the
continuing line. This is best practice as a general rule.
</p>

<div>
<p> Here is the detail. Multi-line field values
are delimited by the first line which starts with a string of
characters without blanks that is ending in the colon character
<code>:</code>. Thus an error will occor if a field name
that is know to ReDIF appears at the beginning of the 
line. Example</p>
<pre>Abstract: This paper is very complicated. It contains three
parts: one dealing with input, the next with output and the third
with throughput.
</pre>
<p>will lead to a parsing error because "parts" is not a field name
known to ReDIF. To put this example right, it is suffient
to write
</p>
<pre>Abstract: This paper is very complicated. It contains three
 parts: one dealing with input, the next with output and the third
with throughput.
</pre>
<p>but it is best to consistently indenent every continuing
line
</p>
<pre>Abstract: This paper is very complicated. It contains three
 parts: one dealing with input, the next with output and the third
 with throughput.
</pre>
</div>


<p>
The default character set for ReDIF is Windows-1252.  This is a a
 superset of the ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin1) character set
 available on non-Windows systems.
</p>

<p>ReDIF files can also be encoded in UTF-8 which allows the use of
characters not available in Windows-1252 or ISO-8859-1. This is
recommended practice.  When you encode a ReDIF file in UTF-8, you have
to include the UTF-8 byte order mark at the beginning of the
file. Most text editors will do this automatically for you.
</p>

<p>Lines in a ReDIF file that start with '#' are used for comments.
</p>

<p>Many fields may be repeated within one record, but repetitions are
discouraged and for some fields they are prohibited. But for example,
here is a person who works in two places
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Sturm, J.F.
Author-Workplace-Name: Erasmus University Rotterdam,
       Econometric Institute 
Author-Workplace-Name: Center for Economic Policy Research
</pre>

<h3>2.3. Order of fields in the template</h3>

<p>The general principle is that all fields may appear in any order
within the template. However there are two important exceptions to
this rule.
</p>

<p>First, every ReDIF templates must start with the Template-type:
field.  The value of this field indicates what type of resource will
be described by this template. Therefore, the set of expected fields
in the template itself depends on that value.  The values for the
template type are given in Subsection 2.1.  The version number must be
quoted after the template type. The version number will make it easier
to implement changes to ReDIF.  At the moment all template types are
in version 1.0. For an example
</p>
<pre>Template-Type: ReDIF-Archive 1.0
</pre>

<p>Any data that does not start with a correct Template-Type:
declaration will be ignored.
</p>

<p>The second restriction of the freedom to group fields is necessary to
express that certain pieces of information have to be kept together.
Consider the case of a paper that has been co-authored by several people.
</p>
<pre>Author-Name:  Smith, Adam
Author-Name: Ricardo, David
Author-Email: Ricardo@classical.econ.org
Author-Email: Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org
Author-Workplace-Name: Institute of Classical Economics
</pre>

<p>Looking at this data you can easily find out that Smith's email
address is <code>Adam.Smith@classical.econ.org</code> and that he
probably works for the Institute of Classical Economics as Ricardo
does. But computer is not able to find that out.  We have to order the
fields in such a way that the computer can understand which email
address corresponds to which person. For each person, the name and the
email address have to be kept together.  There are other instances
where we have to keep some fields in a group.  We call such a group of
fields a cluster.
</p>

<h2>3. Clusters</h2>

<p>A cluster of fields is a group of fields within a template that
belong together.  Clusters are in fact like small templates within
templates.  For example, if we have a template of type "ReDIF-Paper
1.0" that describes a paper with several authors. It would contain
several person clusters, one cluster for each author. If a document is
available online, there should be one or several clusters with
information about the files of the document--the main body of the
text, a dataset that is used etc--as available on the Internet.
</p>

<p>Each type of clusters has it's own field structure. Like templates,
clusters must always start with one particular field, called the "key"
field. Each cluster type has it's own key field.  You should always
keep one cluster's fields together.

</p>

<p>Here is a simple cluster of type "Person" which describes an 
author
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Smith, Joe
Author-Email: JoeSmith@some.uni.edu
Author-Postal: PO Box 123, Smith Street, Somewhere In The,
  Universe, 987654 
Author-Phone: +99 456-321123
Author-Homepage: http://www.some.where.edu/~JoeSmith
</pre>

<p>Here is a cluster of type "Organization" describing a provider of a
series of papers:
</p>

<pre>Provider-Name: Central Publishing House
Provider-Phone: +44-(0)207 226 7063 
Provider-Homepage: http://www.central-publish.net
</pre>


<p>Clusters can be nested. For example, you can put an organization
cluster to describe the organization an author is affiliated with,
within the cluster of this particular author. Here we have an author
who works at two institutions
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Maria Saguvosky
Author-Workplace-Name: The New York Institute of Blasphemy 
Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://www.new-york.blasphemy.org
Author-Workplace-Name: The New Jersey Institute for Blasphemic Research
</pre>
 
<p>Within this document, when we want to show you that you can use
some cluster in a template, we will use a syntax like
Author-(PERSON*), Provider-(ORGANIZATION*), File-(FILE*) etc.  Thus
the clusters below in this document often join a field prefix,
e.g. "Author-", with a cluster type name, e.g. "PERSON", , and a star
sign, between parenthesis.
</p>

<p>When writing clusters you should always remember to put the key
field first. For example, if you write
</p>
<pre>Template-Type: ReDIF-Book 1.0
Title: The Capital
Author-Email: K.Marx@highgate.london.uk
Author-Name: Marx, Karl 
Author-Phone: ...
</pre>

<p>
the Author-Email: field is not recognized, because at that point the
Author-(PERSON*) cluster has not yet started.  This will result in an
error message or in your template being ignored.  But the Author-Name:
field that follows will start the cluster, because "Name" is the key
field of the PERSON cluster. Hence the Author-Phone: field will be
correctly processed.
</p>

<p>This is all you need to know about clusters in general. We now
address the specifics of the different cluster types.
</p>

<h3>3.1. The ORGANIZATION cluster</h3>

<p>The ORGANIZATION cluster is defined by the following fields:</p>

<dl> 
<dt> Name </dt> 
<dd> Name of organization, <em>the key</em> </dd> 
<dt> Homepage </dt> 
<dd> URL of organization's home page </dd> 
<dt> Name-English </dt> 
<dd> English translation of the name of organization </dd> 
<dt> Postal </dt> 
<dd> Postal Address of organization </dd> 
<dt> Location </dt> 
<dd> Name of place where organization is based, e.g. "Harare" </dd> 
<dt> Email </dt> 
<dd> Electronic mail address(es) of organization </dd> 
<dt> Phone </dt> 
<dd> Telephone number(s) of organization </dd> 
<dt> Fax </dt> 
<dd> Fax number(s) of organization </dd> 
<dt> Institution </dt> 
<dd> Handle of an institution template that describes the organization </dd> 
</dl>

<p>
<strong>Name</strong> is the key field of the organization cluster. It should
always be put first. Otherwise the most useful item is the
homepage. Much of the remaining information can be derived from
the homepage. It should be supplied if the homepage information
is missing or the data at the homepage is not specific enough. 
</p>

<p>Here is an example of the organization cluster
use to describe the provider of a working paper series. 
</p>
<pre>Provider-Name:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Provider-Homepage: http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/ 
Provider-Email: feds_papers@frb.gov 
</pre>

<p>If a ReDIF institution template is available, then a better way to
write to describe this institution is
</p>
<pre>Provider-Name:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
Provider-Institution: RePEc:edi:frbgvus
</pre>

<p>In that case, the data of the institution template is used to describe
the institution. It is then no longer necessary to give any further
details about the institution within the template. The advantage of
this representation is that when there is a change in the data for the
institution, it is no longer necessary to update the data for the
institution within each ORGANIZATION cluster within each PERSON
cluster of every author who has written a paper when affiliated with
that institution.
</p>

<h3>3.2. The Person cluster</h3>

<p>The PERSON cluster is used to describe a person. It
has the following fields</p>

<dl>
<dt> Name </dt> 
<dd> Name of person, <em>the key</em> </dd> 
<dt> Name-First </dt> 
<dd> First name of person</dd> 
<dt> Name-Last </dt> 
<dd> Last name of person </dd> 
<dt> Homepage </dt> 
<dd> URL of person's home page </dd> 
<dt> Workplace-(ORGANIZATION*) </dt> 
<dd> Organization in which person works </dd> 
<dt> Email </dt> 
<dd> Electronic mail address(es) of person </dd> 
<dt> Fax </dt> 
<dd> Fax number(s) of person </dd> 
<dt> Postal </dt> 
<dd> Postal address of person </dd> 
<dt> Phone </dt> 
<dd> Telephone contact information </dd> 
<dt> Person </dt> 
<dd> Handle of a person template that describes the 
 person, or short-id for such a person </dd> 
</dl> 

<p><strong>Name</strong> is the key field of the person cluster. It
should always be put first.
</p>

<p>If a ReDIF person template for a person is available, then there is
easy way to describe a person.  This is done through the person
template. For example
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Thomas Krichel
Author-Person: RePEc:per:1965-06-05:thomas_krichel
</pre>
<p>There is also another type of handle for
persons that is commonly used the RePEc project, the short-id.
The short-id can be used as a substitute value in 
the Author-Person field. 
 For example
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Thomas Krichel
Author-Person: pkr1
</pre>
<p>Now all the information about the person, including the
workplace data, is read from the person handle.  No further
information about the person needs to be entered. 
</p>



<h3>3.3. The FILE cluster</h3>

<p>The FILE cluster is used to describe a file that contains
the resource that is being described, or a part of it.
It is defined by the following fields:
</p>

<dl> 
<dt> URL </dt> 
<dd> Uniform Resource Locator of file, <em>the key</em> </dd> 
<dt> Format </dt> 
<dd> The format, e.g. "application/pdf" for PDF files </dd> 
<dt> Function </dt> 
<dd> explains the function of file within the resource </dd> 
<dt> Size </dt> 
<dd> The file size, by default in kilobytes </dd> 
<dt> Restriction </dt> 
<dd> A restriction placed on accessing the file.</dd> 
</dl> 

<p>These fields of the FILE cluster are not self-descriptive as the
fields of the previous clusters.  We describe each of the fields in
more detail.
</p>

<p><strong>URL</strong>: This is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of
the file on the Internet. The URL identifies an access protocol and a
code that this protocol can use to retrieve the resource. Please refer
to <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1738.txt"> RFC1783</a> when
composing a URL.  Any whitespace in the URL will be ignored. Following
RFC1783 any whitespace that follows a dash character "-" is considered
to be a mistake, because it is likely to have been introduced by word
processing software. The URL can be written over several lines, but do
not break it after a dash.
</p>
 
<pre>File-URL: http://www.hhs.se/research/wpecofi/papers/wp0121.pdf.zip
File-URL: ftp://crefe.dse.uqam.ca/pub/cahiers/cah44.ps </pre>

<p>This is the key field of the file cluster. It should always be put
first.
</p>



<p><strong>Format</strong>: This is a an optional field to give a
precise indication about the type of format that is found in the
field.  The Format: field is not repeatable and is case-insensitive.
The contents of this field (all valid values) is restricted by a
controlled vocabulary, the MIME Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
types.  These types are specified in the <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc1521.txt"> RFC1521</a>.  The <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/iana/assignments/media-types/media-types">complete
and up-to-date list</a> of these types is maintained by the IANA.  We
do not support any values for file format that are not listed
there. If you want to convey information about a type that is not
registered here, please contact the IANA.  The most important MIME
types that are used with ReDIF data are <code>application/pdf</code>
and <code>application/postscript</code>, as well
<code>text/html</code>. If you simply want to give a message to the
user about the file, it is best to use the Function: field.
</p>

<p><strong>Function</strong>: This is the function of the file. It
should be used when a file represents only some part of the whole
resource. The field value may indicate what particular part of the
document is represented by the file.  Here are three examples
</p>
<pre>File-Function: Appendix 1
</pre>

<pre>File-Function: Main text
</pre>
 
<pre>File-Function: Fortran program used for the simulations
 reported in the paper 
</pre>


<p>
If the file is a complete rendering of the resource, the
<code>File-Function</code> field should not be used at all.  When we
have different files with no file function, user services should
assume that all are alternative renderings of the complete text.
</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong>: The file size, by default in kilobytes. 
This is an optional and obsolete field. It is not repeatable. Examples
</p>
<pre>File-Size: 48
...
File-Size: 1788984 bytes
</pre>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a
file. If the file can be retrieved by anybody with Internet access
without any preliminary payment or registration, you should
<strong>not</strong> use that field at all. As soon as there is a
restriction on the file many services will be assuming that there is
no public access to the file.  Some user services may wish to display
only non-restricted files and your file will not appear there. If all
files of a document are restricted, please use the field Restriction:
in the template of the resource, rather than repeating it for each
file of the resource.
</p>

<p>Two examples for a complete file cluster</p>
<pre>File-URL: http://rich.com/papers/d_duck.txt
File-Format: text/plain 
File-Function: Abstract

File-URL: http://rich.com/papers/d_duck.pdf
File-Format: application/pdf
File-Function: Main text
File-Size: 13982 bytes
</pre>



<h2>4. The Collection templates</h2>

<p>The collection templates describe archives and series. We list the
fields for these templates by order of importance, the most important
is put first.
</p>



<h3>4.1. The Archive template</h3>

<p>The archive template provides information about how the
bibliographic data in the archive can be mirrored (the URL field) and
gives contact information for the archive (the Maintainer-Email
field).
</p>

<p><strong>Template-type:</strong> <code>ReDIF-Archive 1.0 </code>
</p>

<p>Each archive template must start with this statement.</p>

<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the archive
handle. The handle of the archive is the name of the authority (for
example <code>RePEc</code>), a <code>:</code> and then the
<em>archive_code</em>.  The archive code is proposed by the archive
administrator and awarded by the authority. It should not have
semantic contents.
</p>

<p><strong>URL</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the archive
directory.  The URL should either point to a http or ftp site.  It is
to good practice to have it end with the archive code. <span>This element is repeatable, but reading software may
ignore all but the first value that occurs in a template.</span>
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Email</strong>: This is mandatory field for the email of
somebody in charge of the archive. It is very important to keep it
this field up-to-date. In particular, it is preferable not to use a
personal email address of an employee that may move on later. It is
best to give a general address of the sponsor of the archive. Make
sure that the mail is read there and transmitted to the person who
really maintains the archive.

</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the name
of the archive. 
Even though this name is mandatory, the contents
is not usually shown to end-users. If you want to describe your contents
in some detail, use the series templates.
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Name</strong>: 
This is an optional field  for
the name of a person who is in charge of the archive.
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Phone</strong>: This is an optional field  for the
phone number of a person
in charge of the archive.
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Fax</strong>: This is an optional field for the fax number of a
person in charge of the archive.
</p>

<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: 
This is an optional field  for
subject information for the archive.
Consult the same field in the ReDIF-Paper template and
Appendix A for description.
</p>

<p><strong>Homepage</strong>: This is optional field
for the URL of the archive's homepage. This should 
point to a location that an end user may be interested in. 
</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: This is an optional field  for
a description of the archive's contents.
</p>

<p><strong>Notification</strong>: This is an optional field that may
be used to specify how new papers in the archive are
announced.
</p>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: This is an optional field to specify
access restriction. It should be handle with care. A restriction
mentioned here applies to all files referred to in all resources of
all series in the archive.  If the series can be retrieved by anybody
with Internet access, you should not use that field at all. If not all
of the series that make up the archive are restricted, mention the
restriction only in the series templates of the restricted series.
</p>

<p>Here we have two examples for the archive templates</p>
<pre>Template-type: ReDIF-Archive 1.0
Handle: RePEc:bob
Name: Economics Working Paper Archive at WUSTL
Maintainer-Email: bparks@wueconaa.wustl.edu
URL: ftp://econwpa.wustl.edu/bob

Template-type: ReDIF-Archive 1.0
Handle: RePEc:wop
Name: WoPEc Project
Maintainer-Email: WoP_Ec@netec.mcc.ac.uk
Description: This archive collects information about holding of
 papers on those sites that have not (yet) joined RePEc.
URL: ftp://netec.mcc.ac.uk/pub/NetEc/RePEc/wop
</pre>





<h3>4.2. The Series template</h3>

<p>
The series template provides information about a logical or physical
collect of items, for example a working paper series or a peer-reviewed
journal. The bibliographic information provided here is directly
relevant for end users. In particular the Name field (the name of the
working paper series or journal), the Provider-Name (who supports or
'publishes' the working paper series or journal) and Provider-Homepage
field (where to find more information) are useful.
</p>

<p><strong>Template-type</strong>: <code>ReDIF-Series 1.0 </code>
</p>
<p>
Each series template must start with this statement.
</p>

<p><strong>Name</strong>: This is a mandatory field for the name of
the series.
</p>

<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a mandatory field.
The handle is a unique identifier for the series. It is based on the
handle for the archive holding the data about the series. It consists
of the archive handle followed by a colon (:) and a six-character
series code. The series code must be unique within the archive. It can
contain the letters a-z and the numbers 0-9.
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Email</strong>: This is a mandatory field for
the email address of a person who is in charge of the series' files
but not necessarily of its contents.  The maintainer should be ready
to receive error reports. As with the archive maintainer's email, a
personal address should be avoided.
</p>

<p><strong>Type</strong>: Each series may only contain one type of
templates. This rule is called "Baum's principle". The Type: field is
used to indicate the type.  The default type is "ReDIF-Paper". If the
type of the elements of the series is "ReDIF-Paper", then this field
does not need to be specified.  Other legal series types are
"ReDIF-Software", "ReDIF-Article", "ReDIF-Chapter" and "ReDIF-Book".
</p>

<p><strong>Order-Email</strong>: This is an optional field for the
email address where to send ordering requests to.
</p>

<p><strong>Order-Homepage</strong>: This is an optional field for the
URL of a screen where orders can be placed.
</p>

<p><strong>Order-Postal</strong>: Snail mail address where to order
the paper.
</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong>: Price for all papers in the series when
ordered.  It an be overwritten by a separate Price: field in the paper
</p>

<p><strong>Provider-(ORGANIZATION*)</strong>: This is the organization
that supports the series.  The provider is a more general term than
the usual term "publisher".  If you have a handle for your
institution, please use the Provider-Institution: field after the
Provider-Name: field.
</p>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of all
papers in the series. It has the same meaning as in a FILE cluster.
It implies that all the files of all the documents in that particular
series have this restriction.
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Phone</strong>: This is an optional field for
the phone number of the person in charge of the series
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Fax</strong>: This is as optional field for the
 fax number of some person in charge of the series
</p>

<p><strong>Maintainer-Name</strong>: This is an optional field for the
name of a person that is in charge of the files contained in the
series.
</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong>: This can be a short description of
the series' content.
</p>

<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: This is an
optional field for a subject for the series according to scheme
<em>scheme</em>. Consult the same field in description of the paper
template and Appendix A for description.
</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>[<strong>-</strong>]: This is an optional
field for keywords for the series according to scheme
<em>scheme</em>. Consult the same field in the Paper template and
Appendix A for description.
</p>

<p><strong>Editor-(PERSON*)</strong>: This is the person responsible
for the contents of the series.
</p>

<p><strong>Notification</strong>: This is an optional field to say how
how new papers in the series are announced.
</p>

<p><strong>ISSN</strong>: This is the International Standard Serial
Number for the series, if available.
</p>

<p><strong>Followup</strong>: This is an optional field that takes the
value of another series' handle. That series is the successor of the
series.
</p>

<p><strong>Predecessor</strong>: This is an optional field that takes
the value of another series' handle. That series is the predecessor of
the series.
</p>

<p>Here are two examples for series templates.</p>
<pre>Template-type: ReDIF-Series 1.0
Name: Computational Economics
Description: This is a series for economists who are computer nerds. You
 can not get more of an anorak than that. 
Maintainer-Name: Bob Parks
Maintainer-Email: robert_ parks@wuecona.wustl.edu
Handle: RePEc:bob:wuwpco

Template-type: ReDIF-Series 1.0

<h2>5. The Resource template types</h2>

<h3>5.1. The ReDIF-Paper Template</h3>

<p>This template concerns all documents that are not published as part
of a journal or as part of a book or as a book.  We will be a bit more
verbose here than in Section 5.2 where we describe other templates.
</p>

<p>We will list here the elements of the paper template in decreasing
order of importance. We start with those elements that are
really necessary. We then list those element that are optional
but important. Finally, we turn to those elements that
are not important.
</p>

<p><strong>Template-type</strong>: <code>ReDIF-Paper 1.0 </code>
</p>

<p>Each paper template must start with this statement.
</p>

<p><strong>Title</strong>: The title of the paper. This includes any
subtitles. This is a required field. Use:
</p>
<pre>Title: A Theory of Gradual Trade Liberalisation
</pre>

<p><strong>Author-(PERSON*)</strong>: This is a required cluster field
to describe the person(s) who has authored the document, i.e. who is
responsible for its intellectual content. We recommend the name of the
author should be given in normalized format like "Lastname, Firstname"
but the direct order is also acceptable. Please add the full first
names if you know them, but omit titles, honors etc. If there
are several authors, there should be a separate cluster for each author.
The special author name "et al" should be used when referring to a
list of unknown other names. If you know the authors' names, put all
authors names.  This implies repeating a (PERSON*) cluster for every
author.  These other authors should be placed in separate author
clusters.
</p>

<p>The Author-(PERSON*) field is mandatory.  That means that you
should give at least one Author-Name: field with some value in each
ReDIF-Paper template. Other information about the author is
optional. Please do not overload the templates with author
information. If you want to give elaborate personal information,
register the person with a personal registration service.  Use:
</p>
<pre>Author-Name: Lang, William 
Author-Email: wlang@lsumm.sncc.lsu.edu
Author-Workplace-Name: Center for Economic Performance 
Author-Name: Sturm, J.F.  
Author-Workplace-Name: Erasmus University Rotterdam, Econometric  
 Institute 
Author-Workplace-Postal: P.O. Box 1738, NL- 3000 DR Rotterdam, 
 The Netherlands 
Author-Workplace-Homepage: http://www.eur.nl/few/ei/indexuk.html 
Author-Workplace-Email: eb-webmistress@few.eur.nl 
Author-Homepage: http://www.eur.nl/few/ei/stu.html 
</pre>

<p><strong>Handle</strong>: This is a required field to identify the
bibliographic record.  The Handle: field content starts with the name
of the authority (organization), for example <code>RePEc</code>.  The
next element is the code of the archive, then follows the code of the
series and finally the number of the paper within the series. All
these parts are separated separated by the colon character,
i.e. <code>:</code>. Note that this field may not contain
whitespace. If the <em>Handle</em> is written over several lines, the
processing software will eliminate the whitespace characters on the
line boundaries. Use:
</p>
<pre>Handle: RePEc:bon:bonnsf:a452</pre>

<p><strong>Language</strong>: This field gives
the language used in the paper. The language must be 
expressed as one of the values on ISO 639-1. Other codes
are not available. If the languge is omitted, it is 
assumed to take the value "en". Example:
</p>
<pre>Language: fr</pre>

<p><strong>Contact-Email</strong>: This field gives a contact email
address for the paper. This does not need to be one of the authors'
email address. In some cases where the author does not wish her email
to be in the paper information or when no author email is available,
this field should be used.  Use:
</p>
<pre>Contact-Email: Economics_Secretariat@hicks.gross-uni.yy </pre>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: This is the abstract of the
document. Although we do not require to have an abstract, but we
strongly recommend to provide a detailed abstract, because it
increases the chance of users finding your document within a full-text
database.  If you have a long abstract that has several paragraphs,
you can leave a blank line. Use:
</p>
<pre>Abstract: This is the first paragraph of the abstract.

 This is the second paragraph of the abstract.
</pre>
<p>
However, please recall <span>that it is a good practice
to indent </span> every line that follows the first line with at least
one blank.
</p>

<p><strong>File-(FILE*)</strong>: A file cluster for a component of
the paper. If the paper is contained in only one file, then quote the
URL for that file. If the paper is available in various files, the
file cluster should be repeated. If there are files that do not
contain the full text of the paper, the File-Function: field should be
used to specify the role of the file in the document. Under <em>no
circumstances</em> should the File-(FILE*) cluster be
used to link to an intermediate page where the files can be retrieved
from via further hyperlinks.  Use Order-URL: for this
purpose.
</p>

<p><strong>Classification-</strong><em>scheme</em>: This is the
classification number associated with the document. The
<em>scheme</em> is a code for a classification scheme.  If
there are several classification numbers of the same classification
scheme, they will be separated by a semicolon. This field is not
repeatable, unless there are multiple schemes used. Allowed
(registered) classification schemes and codes are listed in the
Appendix <span class="add">A</span>.  
If you have documents, classified with some other scheme,
just email us your suggestion, and we will register your
scheme. Use:
</p>
 
<pre>Classification-JEL: C12; C30 
</pre>

<p><strong>Keywords[-</strong><em>scheme</em><strong>]</strong>: These
are keywords associated with the text. If there are several keywords
they will be separated by a semicolon.  <em>scheme</em> is the
keywords scheme's code but it can also be empty, to say that the
keywords do not follow a scheme. Keywords: should be used in that
case.  If you have some keywords scheme, we will register it for
you. Use:
</p>
 
<pre>Keywords: Competition; Consumer economics; Ethics;
 Philosophy of economics

Keywords: Accounting theory; Accounting principles; Financial accounting
</pre>

<p><strong>Number</strong>: The number of the paper within the
series. This field is not repeatable.
</p>

<p><strong>Creation-Date</strong>: The date at which the original
document was created. The format should be as similar to the <em>ISO
8601:1988 Data elements and interchange formats--Information
interchange--Representation of dates and times</em> as possible. This
is <em>yyyy</em>[<code>-</code><em>mm</em>[<code>-</code><em>dd</em>]]
where <em>yyyy</em> is the year, <em>mm</em> is the month and
<em>dd</em> is the day, and the square brackets indicate that the
element is optional.  Note that the field should only contain the date
of the creation, no other information. This field is not
repeatable. Use: </p>
<pre>Creation-Date: 1995-06-30 
</pre><p>or</p>
 
<pre>Creation-Date: 1996 
</pre>

<p><strong>Revision-Date</strong>: A date at which the document was
changed.  The format for the value of that field is the same as in
Creation-Date:. This field may be repeated.
</p>
<pre>Revision-Date: 1995-06-30
</pre>

<p><strong>Publication-Status</strong>: This can be used 
 to say if a modified version of the document exists, has been
forthcoming, etc. in a commercial journal, book or other type of
formal publication. It should always start with the word "published"
or the word "forthcoming" (case insensitive). Use: </p>
<pre>Publication-Status: Forthcoming in
  Computational Statistics and Data 
Publication-Status: Published in Journal of Artificial
   Intelligence Research, Vol.3 
Publication-Status: Published in American Journal of 
  Agricultural Economics, 1995, vol. 77, no. 1. pp. 120-134.
Publication-Status: Published by University of Arizona Press 
</pre>



<p><strong>Note</strong>: Any other information that is relevant
for the document. This can be its relation to other documents, a word
or two about the history of the document etc. Use:</p>
<pre>Note: This was an invited paper to a special issue of the 
 Noddyland Journal of Blasphemy
</pre>

<p><strong>Length</strong>: The length of a printed version of the
document, usually in pages. This field is not repeatable.  Use:
</p>
<pre> Length: 29 pages </pre>

<p><strong>Series</strong>: This is the series in which
the document appeared. It should be the same of the
<strong>Name</strong> field in the series template.  Thus this
information is redundant. But you can put it here again.  This field
is not repeatable.
</p>

<p><strong>Availability</strong>: This field can be used to state if a
paper is out of print. If the paper is on the net it should not be
used. It can also be used to say how the get hold of the copy of the
paper.  This field is not repeatable. <span>
The use of this field is deprecated. It is allowed for backwards
compatibility.</span> Use:
</p>
<pre>Availability: out of print </pre>

<p><strong>Order-URL</strong>: This is the URL of an intermediate page
where there is ordering information about the file. The term "ordering
information" should be taken in the widest possible sense. For
example, web page with a set of links to various manifestation of the
paper is a good candidate for an Order-URL:.  Note that the URL should
be specific to the paper. If all the papers in the series have the
same ordering URLs then that information should be put in the series
template.
</p>

<p><strong>Article-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Book-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Chapter-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Paper-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Software-Handle</strong>:
These take values of handles of other publication forms
of the paper. 
</p>

<p>The following elements are not important. They have been 
introduced to integrate legacy data into ReDIF-based system.
</p>

<p><strong>Restriction</strong>: A restriction on the retrieval of a
paper. This is similar to the field of the same name in the File
cluster. If the paper can be retrieved by anybody with Internet
access, you should not use that field at all. Please do not use the
field to make recommendations of the type "please use outside working
hours", since as soon as there is a restriction on a paper many
services will be assuming that there is no public access to it.  If
not all of the files that make up the paper are restricted, mention
the restriction only in the FILE cluster of the restricted file. <span> The use of this field is deprecated. It is allowed for
backwards compatibility.</span>
</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong>: That refers to the price of a printed copy
of the document, when ordered through the ordering channels specified
in the series template.  Use: </p>
 

<pre>Price: $3.00 Surface, $4.00 Air (U.S. $) 
Price: 15 guilders by mail, free by ftp </pre>

<p>For the price of an electronic copy, use the Restriction: field.
</p>

<p><strong>Notification</strong>: to specify how new versions of the
paper are announced. <span> The use of this field is
deprecated. It is allowed for backwards compatibility.</span>
</p>


<p class="add"><strong>Publication-Type</strong>: This field can be
used to specify the type of publication of the document. The
ReDIF-paper template should be used to describe any document that is
not formally published. This includes working papers, but also
documents of all types that are deposited in an institutional
repository and hence for which the holding institution can not be
labelled as the formal publisher (in the <span class="change">restrictive</span> sense of the
word). Examples of these are postprint versions of articles, author
versions of book chapters or conference contributions. This field
permits to distinguish between these different types of
documents. Allowed values for this field are listed in the Appendix
<span class="change">B</span>.
</p>


<p>Here  are two examples of ReDIF templates of type "ReDIF-Paper 1.0".
This is a simple document available only in PostScript format.

Title:  Phases of Imitation and Innovation in a North-South 
  Endogenous Growth  Model
Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a North-South endogenous growth
  model to examine three phases of development in the South: imitation
  of Northern products, imitation and innovation and finally, innovation
  only. In particular, the model has the features of catching up (and
  potentially overtaking) which are of particular relevance to the 
  Pacific Rim economies.  We show that the possible equilibria 
  depend on cross-country assimilation effects and the ease of
  imitation.  We then apply the model to analyze the impact of R&amp;D
  subsidies.  There are some clear global policy implications which
  emerge from our analysis.  Firstly, because subsidies to Southern
  innovation benefit the North as well, it is beneficial to the North
  to pay for some of these subsidies.  Secondly, because the ability
  of the South to assimilate Northern knowledge and innovate depends
  on Southern skills levels, the consequent spillover benefits on 
  growth make the subsidizing of Southern education by the North
  particularly attractive.

</p>

<h3>5.2. ReDIF templates for other documents</h3>

<p>In this Subsection, we look at templates that describe other forms of
scientific documents.
</p>

<h4>5.2.1. The ReDIF-Article Template</h4>

<p>An article is something that appeared in a journal or is forthcoming
in a journal. This is a
template for such publications.
</p>

<p><strong>Template-Type</strong>: ReDIF-Article 1.0</p>

<p>
The template must start with this field.
</p>

<p><strong>Handle</strong>: Handle of journal article. This is a
required field. It is of the same form as the handle of the paper
template. As far as the series identifier is concerned, only series
of articles are admissible here. Note that a journal is a nothing else
than a series of articles. It therefore has a series code like a paper
series. It can be referred to as a "journal code" in casual language,
but the reader should keep in mind that as far as the structure of
ReDIF is concerned the journal is nothing else than a series.
</p>

<p>The component of the handle that describes
an individual article is up to the maintainer of the data.
All that is required is that it is unique 
within the journal series.
Appendix <span class="change">C</span> documents a  scheme that is used
a lot within <a href="http://repec.org/">RePEc</a>.
</p>

<p>The usual location information of an article is very useful to its
citation. ReDIF fields that accomplish these are listed here.  None of
these fields is repeatable. They are fields that are specific to the
article template, i.e. they do not appear in the paper template.
</p>

<p><strong>Journal</strong>: This is the journal in
which the paper appeared. It should be the same of the
<strong>Name</strong> field in the series template.  Thus this
information is redundant. But you can put it here again.  This field
is not repeatable.
</p>

<p><strong>Volume</strong>: The volume number that the article
appeared in.
</p>

<p><strong>Year</strong>: Year of publication of the article.
</p>

<p><strong>Issue</strong>: The number or name of the issue
in which the article appeared.
</p>

<p><strong>Month</strong>: The month where the journal issue where the
article is appeared in.
</p>

<p><strong>Pages</strong>: The pages of the article in the journal in
the form <em>start</em><code>-</code><em>end</em>, where
<em>start</em> is the number of the first page and <em>end</em> is the
number of the last page.
</p>

<p><strong>Number</strong>: The number of the article within the
journal. This field is not repeatable and indicates a number that has
been given to a electronic article without page numbers.</p>


<p><strong>Article-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Book-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Chapter-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Paper-Handle</strong>,
<strong>Software-Handle</strong>:
These take values of handles of other publication forms
of the article. 
</p>

<p>Other fields are like the paper template except that the following
are not valid: <span>Availability:, 
<span class="gone">Note:,</span> Length:,
Revision-Date: and Series:.</span>
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>What happens if you wish to provide data about the formal
publication, i.e., within a journal, of a paper for which you have
ReDIF-Paper information. This is called Sune's problem. The basic
status is that it is not possible for you to provide information about
an article that you have published in a journal. It is for the journal
or some agent of the journal to provide that information, because all
the information about all the articles has to be kept together in once
directory. However, you can give the Article handle, and a ReDIF
literate individual should be able to find the information.

<h2>Appendix <span class="change">C</span>: Suggestion for article
handles</h2>

<p>
This appendix is a suggestion on how to generate
article handles. These suggestions have been taken
up by the <a href="http://repec.org/">RePEc</a> project. 
</p>

<p>The article code in the unique identifier of a single article
within a journal. We suggest that it is a concatenation of qualifiers,
separated by the colon character <code>:</code>. Each qualifier is an
<em>field</em><code>:</code><em>value</em> pair. The <em>field</em> is
represented by one letter only. This is best understood by an example.
</p>

<p>RePEc:xxx:joinec:v:19:y:1985:i:2:Q:1:p:67-84
</p>

<p>The qualifiers currently defined are the following. We list a name for
the qualifier, the letter of the qualifier, a description of values
and a perl regular expression that that can be used to verify the
syntax of the qualifier, as well as an optional additional check. All
regular expressions are case insensitive.<br>
</p>

<p>Name: volume<br>

<p>Name: issue<br>
Value: which issue within the year. If the issue is a month, then
  we give the English three letter start of the month: JAN, FEB
  MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC. The numbers of the
  months are also allowed here, but that is discouraged. If the issue is a
  quarter, we use Q1, Q2 etc. If the issue has a start
  date, put that date like 04-01 for 1 April. Note that you need
  to put the - separator here because the date is otherwise mistaken
  to be the number of the issue.There is no need to put an end date
  for this issue. You can repeat the issue qualifier
  if the physical issue covers several logical issues. SPE can be
  added to say it is a special editions, and S can be 
  postponed for a supplement. <br>
RegEx: i:(($months\d*)($season[S]*)(Q[1234])(\d+)(\d\d-\d\d))
  where <br> $month="(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)"
  and <br>$season="(spr|sum|aut|win|spe)"
